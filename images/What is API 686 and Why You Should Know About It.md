API 686 is a recommended practice for machinery installation and installation design published by the American Petroleum Institute (API). It provides guidelines and best practices for installing, aligning, grouting, piping, wiring, and testing of machinery such as pumps, compressors, turbines, fans, blowers, and gearboxes.
  
API 686 was first published in 1996 and revised in 2009. It is intended to complement other API standards such as API 610 for centrifugal pumps, API 617 for centrifugal compressors, and API 670 for machinery protection systems. It covers topics such as:
  
- Pre-installation requirements and preparations
- Foundation design and construction
- Mounting plate design and fabrication
- Grouting materials and procedures
- Machinery alignment methods and tolerances
- Piping design and installation
- Electrical wiring and grounding
- Lubrication systems and oil mist preservation
- Machinery testing and acceptance criteria
- Documentation and records

The benefits of following API 686 are numerous. It can help you to:

- Ensure the reliability and performance of your machinery
- Reduce vibration, noise, wear, and maintenance costs
- Extend the service life of your equipment
- Avoid failures, accidents, and downtime
- Comply with industry standards and regulations
- Improve safety and environmental protection

## How to Apply API 686 in Your Projects
  
Now that you have a basic understanding of what API 686 is and why it is important, you may be wondering how to apply it in your projects. Here are some steps you can follow to ensure that your machinery installation and installation design are in accordance with API 686:

1. Review the pre-installation requirements and preparations. This includes checking the equipment specifications, drawings, manuals, and data sheets; verifying the availability and condition of the tools, instruments, and materials; inspecting the site and foundation; and preparing the installation plan and schedule.
2. Install the mounting plate and grout it properly. This includes selecting the appropriate grout material and type; preparing the foundation surface and mounting plate; installing the leveling jackscrews and pads; applying the grout; and removing the jackscrews and sealing the holes.
3. Align the machinery using the recommended methods and tolerances. This includes selecting the alignment method (such as reverse indicator, laser, or optical); measuring the alignment before and after bolting; correcting the misalignment by adjusting the shims or jackscrews; and verifying the alignment after grouting.
4. Design and install the piping according to the best practices. This includes selecting the pipe size, material, and supports; avoiding excessive bends, elbows, reducers, orifices, valves, and strainers; ensuring proper clearance and flexibility; minimizing thermal expansion and stress; and testing the piping for leaks.
5. Wire and ground the electrical components correctly. This includes selecting the wire size, type, and insulation; following the wiring diagrams and schematics; ensuring proper connections and terminations; providing adequate protection devices and fuses; and testing the electrical system for continuity and resistance.
6. Install and maintain the lubrication system and oil mist preservation. This includes selecting the lubricant type, grade, and quantity; installing the lubrication lines, pumps, filters, coolers, heaters, reservoirs, and monitors; ensuring proper lubricant flow, pressure, temperature, level, and quality; and applying oil mist preservation if specified by the equipment vendor.
7. Test the machinery before start-up and acceptance. This includes performing pre-operational checks; conducting no-load and load tests; measuring vibration, noise, temperature, pressure, flow, speed, power, efficiency, and performance; comparing the test results with the acceptance criteria; and documenting the test records.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your machinery installation and installation design are in compliance with API 686. This will help you to achieve optimal results in terms of reliability, performance, safety, and environmental protection.
